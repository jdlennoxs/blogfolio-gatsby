The tools available today make it easier than ever for developers to make their work accessible and available to a wider audience. Combining that work with explanation and insight makes that work all the more valuable. I know the concept of the dev blog is nothing new but I want to be able to share my ideas and projects.

I have worked as a software engineer for 6 years and love applying myself to both technical and product problems. Yet I have often found my personal projects suffer from a lack of direction and as such receives less priority.

In creating a public facing blog/portfolio (blogfolio), I hope to force my own hand in this respect, and use this as motivation for my professional development. Writing up projects, ideas and opinions strikes me as a way to achieve validation for the work put in, even if no one is reading it, doubling as a living resume of my skills and compentencies. This is also, mainly, a chance for me to geek out over something I find enjoyable and interesting. If it can provide help or guidance to others, then that's a bonus.

Knowing that ultimately this is a public forum has already affected my attitudes - I have spent far to much time dabbling with CSS already - and is part of becoming a well rounded technologist. Making the most of this experience can only help in becoming more [T shaped](https://medium.com/@jchyip/why-t-shaped-people-e8706198e437).
